% CONSTRAINTS TO ADD%
vate
% Constrain activities to be active whenever their sheet is active

% constraint first activity of a work sheet to be at the same time as the starting time of the sheet 

% constarint the starting time of the work sheet to be between the start and the end IFF its  wokr sheets to be activned (reificatio)

% constarint mondratory work sheets to be active

% constraint worksheets to be in the reight order IFF they are active reification

% constraint the maximum number of roads the be blocked at the same time to be 

%constarint the work center capacity. The data structures for that are not even active jet

% constraint first activity of a worksheet to be at 0 if it is not activated ? Maybe if reification makes the search slow?

% constarint all activities of a sheet ( those between start and end ) to start after their predecessor ended

% define objective funtion and solve
